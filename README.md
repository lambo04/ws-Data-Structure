I used the Visualgo.net website to explore and interact with different data structures and algorithms. It provided a dynamic visualization of concepts like arrays, linked lists, queues, and hash tables, helping me understand their operations like insertion and deletion. The real-time feedback made it easier to grasp how each data structure behaves under various scenarios. It was useful for comparing different structures based on their performance and use cases. However, I feel that adding interactive exercises could further enhance the learning experience.
